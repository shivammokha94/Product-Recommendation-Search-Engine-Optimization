293084452538707968,'It ended up storming for a few days straight when we were going to the hospital. Tim had a doctor appointment today so we're going tomorrow.'
289923451324604416,'Tim is finally finished working. We're going to the abandoned hospital sometime this weekend.'
289857782260301826,'Who is "she", exactly? Jessica? Does ToTheArk know where she is?'
289856689811894272,'So finally, that translates to "truly your fault" and "she's out there" for the ToTheArk video. And "I am watching" for the tweet.'
289856245215682560,'The reversed numbers only have one letter for them, along with the number they're reversing.'
289855637242916865,'So that's 13 number pairs, with the reversed ones left over. 26 letters in the alphabet. Each number must have two letters for it.'
289562130112471040,'All that being said, the full order I've figured out is 13, 24, 35, 46, 57, 68, 79, 83, 95, 03, 15, 27, 39.'
289548185611952128,'Judging by the 83-95 and 27-39 pattern, what comes after 03 could be 15. Second number plus two.'
289535920586256384,'83 could come after 79, too. The pattern started off with 3 as the second digit. 95 might come after that too.'
289531006132813824,'Adding in an unused number (46), I've found what might be a complete pattern: 13, 24, 35, 46, 57, 68, and 79.'
289053359229505536,'Still no progress on this code. Tim suggested that there might be an order the numbers are supposed to go in before it can be deciphered.'
288432911101874176,'A couple of number pairs follow another pattern, I think. The second number increases by two. 83-95 and 27-39.'
288404739782242304,'13, 24, 35, 57, 68, 79 all follow the pattern I noticed earlier. 03 doesn't. Could there be a point where the first number starts from zero?'
288371140810919937,'If that new string of numbers follows the same rules as the others, it adds a few new pairs to work with.'
288364531690901504,'It should go without saying that I'm not the one that did the last tweet.'
288221757188501504,'9513390313793583953179'
288056073435365376,'I'm getting confused. Taking a break from this for a few hours. Tim let me know he's working on it too so hopefully he'll get something.'
288055182674239488,'Sorry, only meant 57 with the previous tweet. 72 doesn't follow that pattern, even when reversed.'
288054140792356864,'Maybe 75 and 72 don't follow the pattern. They're just a mirrored version of the ones that do?'
288028894815203328,'Just noticed a few of these numbers have a pattern. First digit plus two. 13, 24, 57, 68, 79 all follow it.'
287729897777020929,'Two of the pairs are mirrors and are grouped together twice. 27-72 and 57-75. Not sure what that could mean yet though. Common letters?'
287680660456472576,'Seems unlikely that all 26 letters of the alphabet are used, too. Just need to figure out which ones could be missing...'
287655736866111488,'If a pair equals one letter, there's 26 letters in total. But there's only 9 unique numbers. Could each number have multiple letters?'
287455250384814080,'Still working on it. There's an even amount of numbers in each set, and a few number pairs repeat. Maybe a pair corresponds to a letter?'
287358948116418560,'Still can't figure out the numbers at the end of the latest ToTheArk video. It's driving me crazy.'
286242261476450304,'Whoever ToTheArk is, they don't have original footage of Jessica. Not that they've shown so far. Maybe they don't know where she is either?'
286240694337695744,'Was just linked this. Looks like that shot of Jessica in the latest ToTheArk was taken from previous footage of mine. http://t.co/w3bW1oEp'

174952310819143680,'There's a ton of people in here. Must be a hell of a sale.'
174938961532301312,'About to head over to the store. Hopefully someone there can tell me about Tim.'
172418936590176258,'Drove by the store today. They had hung up a "going out of business sale" sign, still closed though. Surely they'll be open this week?'
169959793543495680,'Made it back outside. I'm leaving before the guy comes back out and recognizes me.'
169958043700838401,'He just went upstairs. Sounds like he's dragging something heavy across the floor. I'm taking a chance and getting out of here.'
169953980972142592,'He's wandering around the store looking for something, I think. I really hope it's not in this room.'
169951539618791424,'He's talking on his phone with someone. Said he's done with all the deliveries except for one.'
169947502873808896,'Just heard the truck pull up behind the store. Hiding.'
169945777043550208,'The person in the center has a weird face. It's just two circles and a nose. But the rest of the picture is so detailed.'
169944174911684608,'And this one. Looks similar to the other. http://t.co/0isqQ0Ik'
169942111251214337,'One of the few left. http://t.co/4tND9dsu'
169940521991684100,'One of the rooms is nearly empty. Only a few paintings left. Maybe it's the room that guy was taking stuff out of?'
169939812688728065,'@MrSkolVikes28 All the display cases are locked.'
169936343147888641,'One of the other display cases is full of dolls. http://t.co/S6vBdcQ5'
169931783591297025,'Found a pile of old cameras in one of the display cases. http://t.co/EokeRNam'
169927903327424513,'Lots of paintings of wooded areas in here. http://t.co/5DNlkzdD'
169923727314784256,'Looking around. http://t.co/OUjO3HZj'
169919065505267712,'I don't see anyone else in there right now so I'm going inside. http://t.co/Duo28khF'
169915693574266882,'He just left. I didn't see him lock the back door though.'
169906066312806400,'He hasn't seen Tim. Told me he's the delivery driver for the store, so he's rarely sitting behind the counter inside.'
169886300671971328,'Going to go around to the back and ask him if he's seen Tim around, whenever he comes back out.'
169883446448111616,'The guy in the truck showed up again outside the store a few minutes ago.'
168824551533314049,'@SOREN2011 No, I did not.'
168824461968162816,'.@ZamAfRocs He unlocked the back door himself, so he's probably an employee.'
168809721778806786,'He just left. He had loaded up a few large boxes in the back of his truck. I guess he was some kind of delivery driver?'
168801377752059904,'I also asked if it would ever be open again. He said it will, since they're trying to sell off their current inventory.'
168801055927304192,'Just asked him when the store will be open. He said it's in the process of closing down for good.'
168781249907916800,'Some guy just got out of the truck and went in through the back of the store. Gonna go try and talk to him when he comes out.'
168776863420919809,'A truck just pulled up behind the building. No one's gotten out of it for a few minutes.'
168759386653736961,'Outside the store again. Trying to look inconspicuous on the bench across the street. Not sure if I'm succeeding at that or not.'
166985112901255168,'Showed up early this morning at the store to see if anyone ever came. Nothing as of yet. Lights were on inside, though. http://t.co/EmbG787L'
164442379917590528,'Accidentally slept late today. I think I'm going to try and go back to that store really early soon and just wait for someone to show up.'
163343394767253504,'Store's still closed. I looked through the window, and it seemed like an antique store of some kind?'
161910822338174976,'Back in the downtown area. The store that Tim walked out of when I saw him is always closed when I'm here. No hours posted either.'
161186858938793984,'This place is the epitome of a small town. Almost everything is closed on Sundays.'
160498845447503872,'There has to be somewhere around here that Tim would frequent.'
159443735053217793,'@rulerofeden Not yet, I've asked a few random people around town but came up with nothing.'
159443499912151041,'@poristhead Whenever something happens worth putting on the channel.'
159415754008174592,'Didn't sleep for the entire weekend. Feeling dead.'
157908675007221760,'@msmarvelli Don't think so. Can't really remember though.'
157905093650427905,'Couldn't sleep last night. First time that's happened in a while.'
157572980745060353,'Drove by Rosswood Park today. Almost stopped, but then I realized that's a terrible idea. Why did I even consider it?'
156879741029318656,'@SwagBruceington That's the problem. I don't trust anyone.'
156870266805420033,'Going to look outside of the downtown area soon. There is still Rosswood park, but I'm not going there alone.'
156219360149635073,'No luck again. Maybe Tim isn't a regular around here and it was just a lucky coincidence that I saw him when I did?'
155907634476752896,'No luck today. Maybe there will be more people there tomorrow.'
155750421036666880,'Getting back out there today. Maybe I'll ask some people around downtown if they've seen anyone that looks like Tim.'
145645273102815234,'@BraveDave88 I'm not going to say anything for sure.'
145641687774003200,'I've been sleeping much too well recently. It's an odd change of pace.'
141198583989944321,'No sign of Tim as of right now. Still in the downtown area.'
135776704596672512,'Entry #52 has been reuploaded with the typo fixed: http://t.co/GuTKRFjW'

123868128659779584,'Found it.'
123513828725096449,'Finally have a chance to look through the mass of tapes for the 56-42 label.'
123501738216005633,'Really paranoid. Had to change my location after I woke up with my hotel room door standing wide open. Nothing seems to be missing, though.'

118407783291953152,'@GreyouTT Yes, I've checked everything. Found nothing.'
118406415244197888,'@GreyouTT Then wouldn't there be a news story about it somewhere at least? I can't find anything.'
