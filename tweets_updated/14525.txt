'@Iberia_en It's not. It's with American as they were our last flight....however I would love to talk to Iberia. What is number in U.S.?'
'@Iberia_en Can I file a claim with Iberia? Our first flight was IB, next 2 AA, but apparently AA never got the bags from Iberia...'
'@Iberia_en The report is with @AmericanAir but the tags do start with IB. It's been 4 days and the bags have yet to be located.'

'@AmericanAir thanks, we are...gets tricky when 2 tags are assigned to you but last AA rep was great. Hope bags are found...'
'@AmericanAir the luggage however is another issue as apparently the tags we have don't match the tags you have on record...'
'@AmericanAir Well we made it onto flight after being ping ponged around and told to wait and then not wait and almost missing the flight...'
