'In bed he was a mystery like Schr√∂dinger's cat. He was both turned on and turned off, he was both erect and flaccid at the same time.'

'" show me yours boy, I'll show you mine" she said naughtily.   "Alright " he said "here's my limited edition Han Solo Blaster, what you got?'
'"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn" she sang suggestively. Confusing it for sing-off he sang back "this girl is on fire."'
'After numerous failed attempts he finally managed to get it erect. There was nothing that could stop him from building a Lego Eiffel tower.'
'https://t.co/GqFkLh8qD0'
'" It feels so tight and warm inside" he said. The wardrobe was his favourite place to hide when they played hide-and-seek.'
'Use some spit, stroke it is till it's erect, then gently slide it into the hole' she said. He didn't know how to thread a needle.'
'"Hold it in your hand and slide it further in, yes that's the sweet spot" he said. "Now that's how you connect an HDMI cable to an Xbox."'

'' I like it long, and I like it hard ' she whispered in his ears. 'Alright here it is ' he replied as he gave her his math homework.'
'" I want you go down under today" she whispered seductively in his ears.  "But why'? he asked 'why do I have to go Australia? ''
''Let's try a different position today' she said excitingly. 'Alright' he replied and then moved the sofa 1.5 metres from the TV and the PS4.'
''Don't make it fast' she said ' i like it slow.' 'Alright then' he replied and hooked her computer to a 56k modem.'
''Hurt me ' she said leaning over the desk. 'Alright ' he said 'you're so fat, if you sat on a binary tree it'll flatten into a linked list''
'It was between her legs and she was desperately trying to ride it, but his Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000 broomstick¬†replica just wouldn't fly.'
''Hurt me!' she cried, pressing her body up against the wall. 'Alright,' he said. 'You're a terrible cook and I fancy your sister.''

''Hurt me,' she begged, raising her skirt as she bent over my workbench. 'Very well,' I replied, 'You've got fat ankles and no dress sense.''
'Her fingers played all over his body until she found it and gently eased it in.  At last she'd finished her Luke Skywalker jigsaw.'
''Mmmm that's it,' she moaned, 'Now pinch it between your fingers, wiggle it about then pull gently.' She was the noisiest Jenga player ever.'
''So,' she asked, 'Have you suffered enough?' 'Yes!' I cried, desperately, 'No more emails with pictures of kittens wearing hats!''
'" I am in the mood tonight darling" she said, dressed in sexy stockings. "Me too" he replied, let's play "Halo".'

'She leaned over the table, "Take me now!" She moaned. So he took her Queen and checkmated her.'
'Frantically I tore off her dress, bra and knickers. My heart was racing but I just managed to close the wardrobe door before she got home.'
'"It's too big," She said. "I can barely put my hand around it!." " Use both hands baby" I replied. She didn't knew how to hold a lightsaber.'
'Oooh! she squealed, 'Yours is the biggest I've ever seen! 'I know,' he grinned, 'And it comes with an iPencil and a detachable keyboard.''

'He accidentally mixed up his Viagra with his laxatives, couldn't say If he was coming or going.'
''Hold my wrists!' she begged, 'I need to be restrained!' 'Alright' I said, 'But wouldn't it be easier just to delete your Facebook account?''
'As soon as I closed the door, the sparks really began to fly. I guess she was right about not putting baked bean tins in the microwave.'
'She told me she was into extreme bondage . . . so I took her to see Skyfall six times.'
'Feeling experimental she tells him that she wants to try a threesome. "Alright" he says and invites Dr Sheldon Cooper for a Halo threesome.'
''So many accomplishments, Mr Grey'. She said as she inspected his Candy Crush high score.'
''I want it now against this wall!' she ordered, 'And keep it up as long as possible.' 'Don't worry,' I said, 'I know how to put up a shelf.''
'He enjoyed 3.141592 in a bed. He was Pi-sexual.'
''Pleasure and pain can be experienced simultaneously,' he grinned, handing her a slice of pizza as they watched The Phantom Menace.'

''It's so long and hard!' she said, stroking the shaft. 'Of course,' I beamed 'It's a limited edition replica Return of the Jedi lightsaber.''
''Remove your clothes,' she said in a calm, clear voice. 'Now bend over the table.' He silently obeyed. There was no point arguing with Siri.'
'She knelt naked before him, breasts heaving with desperate desire but he just stood there in silence. He didn't know how to talk to girls.'
'"she wanted to be tied up for hours.... I thought she'd appreciate if I left her on hold with tech support"'
'Her body tensed and quivered as she felt wave after wave surge through it. I probably should have told her about the new electric fence.'
'"Do you like it rough" he asked. "As hard as it can be" she answered, as he set the games difficulty to extreme and passed the controller.'
'I inserted my finger, wiggled it around then removed it. She moaned as I entered, 'When are you going to get a new key for that shed door?''
'She gasped as it became harder and stiffer the moment she touched it. I probably should've warned her about that quick-set cement.'
