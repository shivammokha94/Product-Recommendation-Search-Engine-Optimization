'@TAMAirlines the agency then put me back with your rep who took all my info, submitted some request, told me to wait 2 days, and it's been 3'
'.@TAMAirlines I was told a representative would contact me within 24-48 hours to resolve my ticket situation...been 72 hours and counting...'
'.@Delta Turns out they do! Your initial ticket money is still good, but only if you pay a $200 fee and buy a new ticket, full price! THANKS👍'
'Due to international flight delays I missed my domestic flight with .@Delta and I'm left wondering if they will honor the money I paid...'
'@TAMAirlines thanks for the help?'
'.@TAMAirlines I'm aware thanks. The issue is, they won't apply what I've already paid toward a new ticket'
'.@TAMAirlines Your rep can't find our itinerary and won't honor the value of the tickets already paid for'
'.@TAMAirlines I've already paid for 2 tickets, why can't I use their value towards new tickets for the same gig to JFK flight'
'@TAMAirlines 9577712864691 and 9577712864690'
'@TAMAirlines One rep said my flight stays open for use in future, show up a few days later and my ticket is no good'
'@TAMAirlines Trying to rebook a flight out of GIG, but rep says there's no itinerary in system and won't let me use money toward new ticket'
'.@TAMAirlines So you won't rebook my flight, or give me a refund, then you say my itinerary has been lost! My last time with TAM no doubt'
