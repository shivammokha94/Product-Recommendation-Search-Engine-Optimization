'Just watched the tape. Things aren't good right now. Need sleep. Uploading entry 76 later tonight.'
'I can't help but think, what if Tim WAS hiding it for a reason and I'm better off not watching it? Or was he just lying to cover for himself'
'I haven't watched the tape yet, but I'm going to soon.'

'Just noticed that this was uploaded to the channel. Should go without saying that Jay and I had nothing to do with it http://t.co/k3E0xiPXqD'
'This is Tim. Jay gave me the password for this in case I ever need it. He's been kind of out of it since we got away from that house.'

'For those of you asking, I'm still here. Tim and I have been busy looking for something and I think we finally found where it is.'
'Uploading Entry #71 at some point tonight.'
'I think I can get at least one more of these tapes to play. Working on it.'

'Entry #67.5: http://t.co/Lo5BNp7m3a'
'I really need to get out of this place.'
'His eyes were missing, and he constantly made these awful, high pitched screams inches from my ear.'
'Dozed off a little while ago and had a really vivid nightmare that Alex found out where I am.'
'I've hardly slept at all since seeing the footage from that tape. Alex is somewhere around here.'
'Entry #67: http://t.co/eu6VgyBa'
'Still trying to get the rest of the tape to work. I'll upload whatever I get from it sometime tomorrow.'
'I've got the first few minutes of the tape playing now.'
'Great. The tape I found must've been laying in that spot for a while. There's dirt in it and it's not playing at all.'
'Entry #66: http://t.co/4h6xLbJh'
'It ended up storming for a few days straight when we were going to the hospital. Tim had a doctor appointment today so we're going tomorrow.'
'Tim is finally finished working. We're going to the abandoned hospital sometime this weekend.'
'Who is "she", exactly? Jessica? Does ToTheArk know where she is?'
'So finally, that translates to "truly your fault" and "she's out there" for the ToTheArk video. And "I am watching" for the tweet.'
'The reversed numbers only have one letter for them, along with the number they're reversing.'
'So that's 13 number pairs, with the reversed ones left over. 26 letters in the alphabet. Each number must have two letters for it.'
'All that being said, the full order I've figured out is 13, 24, 35, 46, 57, 68, 79, 83, 95, 03, 15, 27, 39.'
'Judging by the 83-95 and 27-39 pattern, what comes after 03 could be 15. Second number plus two.'
'83 could come after 79, too. The pattern started off with 3 as the second digit. 95 might come after that too.'
'Adding in an unused number (46), I've found what might be a complete pattern: 13, 24, 35, 46, 57, 68, and 79.'
'Still no progress on this code. Tim suggested that there might be an order the numbers are supposed to go in before it can be deciphered.'
'A couple of number pairs follow another pattern, I think. The second number increases by two. 83-95 and 27-39.'
'13, 24, 35, 57, 68, 79 all follow the pattern I noticed earlier. 03 doesn't. Could there be a point where the first number starts from zero?'
'If that new string of numbers follows the same rules as the others, it adds a few new pairs to work with.'
'It should go without saying that I'm not the one that did the last tweet.'
'9513390313793583953179'
'I'm getting confused. Taking a break from this for a few hours. Tim let me know he's working on it too so hopefully he'll get something.'
'Sorry, only meant 57 with the previous tweet. 72 doesn't follow that pattern, even when reversed.'
'Maybe 75 and 72 don't follow the pattern. They're just a mirrored version of the ones that do?'
'Just noticed a few of these numbers have a pattern. First digit plus two. 13, 24, 57, 68, 79 all follow it.'
'Two of the pairs are mirrors and are grouped together twice. 27-72 and 57-75. Not sure what that could mean yet though. Common letters?'
'Seems unlikely that all 26 letters of the alphabet are used, too. Just need to figure out which ones could be missing...'
'If a pair equals one letter, there's 26 letters in total. But there's only 9 unique numbers. Could each number have multiple letters?'
'Still working on it. There's an even amount of numbers in each set, and a few number pairs repeat. Maybe a pair corresponds to a letter?'
'Still can't figure out the numbers at the end of the latest ToTheArk video. It's driving me crazy.'
'Whoever ToTheArk is, they don't have original footage of Jessica. Not that they've shown so far. Maybe they don't know where she is either?'
'Was just linked this. Looks like that shot of Jessica in the latest ToTheArk was taken from previous footage of mine. http://t.co/w3bW1oEp'
'New ToTheArk video. http://t.co/PFT0EtUM'
'Dozed off earlier and had a really horrible nightmare. I can't remember what happened in it. At all. Can't sleep now.'
'@veroreos He's been working at the same place since I found him, I believe.'
'@SDK_Films No, not at all.'
'Tim has been working constantly ever since Entry #65. Told me it's to get some money saved up. I think he's considering quitting his job.'
'Entry #65: http://t.co/0sTMrW5i'
'Uploading Entry #65 tomorrow.'
'Still no word from Tim. I'm trying to work up the courage to go back to Rosswood to find him, but could he even still be there?'
'I'm late on it, but ToTheArk updated a few days ago: http://t.co/XmSJT6e4'
'Entry #64: http://t.co/Va9ZmGFl'

'Of course I'm bringing a flashlight this time.'
'I'm fine, for those asking. Going back to the hospital Wednesday.'
'Going back to the abandoned hospital soon. Wish I wouldn't be doing it alone.'
'Entry #59 will be uploaded today.'
'Tim just called, he wants to meet with me later tonight and "talk about something important".'
'Decided I'm going to come clean with Tim the next time I see him. Don't have much to lose.'
'Still no word from Tim, hoping he hasn't disappeared again for whatever reason.'
'Thinking of telling Tim about what's really going on. Maybe it'll get him on my side. Maybe it'll just really piss him off.'
'Entry #58: http://t.co/Qs6uryLl'
'To those asking, I'm okay. Just been feeling very sick since getting back from that place.'
'@jtsunshineevans I am, just in case.'
'@HeylookitsmexD Because he seems to be acting normal now. I don't want to mess with that since it's helping me out.'
'Back from meeting with Tim. We're going out to the abandoned hospital this Friday. Still acting like I want to finish Alex's movie.'
'Leaving now to meet with Tim during his break from work.'
'Meeting with Tim tomorrow to ask if he can show me the abandoned hospital from the previous entries.'
'totheark responds: http://t.co/L3bWwArq'
'@SOGTheReaper I don't know where else to go, but I'm going to keep an eye on Tim while we're out there. Prepared for anything.'

'Entry #55: http://t.co/BSGwzSF4'
'@SwagBruceington Wow. I assume at least THAT part is directed towards Alex, then. Sounds incredibly threatening.'
'@PretzelNU I have no doubts that he/she/they will try. Always on my guard.'
'It's hard to tell who the video is directed towards. My guess would be Alex, considering the date. But that's just a guess.'
'ToTheArk responds: http://t.co/y4Ujeg4P'
'According to "enttry 37", today is Alex's birthday.'
'@BCoxBox I remember the night when it started raining, yeah. But as you saw, I left once we got back to Tim's apartment.'
'Entry #54: http://t.co/H7Q0BwvR'
'Uploading Entry #54 later tonight.'
'Just got back from meeting Tim. Got a bag full of tapes. Again.'
'@daninjango I am. Meeting him in a public place, too. Just in case.'
'@Lost_Creature13 Whenever I watch the tapes from Tim. Assuming there's something important on them.'
'Tim called today. Said he found his tapes. Getting them from him at some point tomorrow.'
'I never noticed anyone following me around while I was outside the store. Going to be looking over my shoulder whenever I'm out there now.'
'ToTheArk responds. Wasn't expecting it so soon: http://t.co/2xJZJLVG'
'No call from Tim yet. I assume he's still looking though.'
'Entry #53: http://t.co/AgbA4gpc'
'Had my camera with me all week. Entry #53 will be uploaded tomorrow.'
'Now that I think about it, I'm not sure what I'm going to say to Tim if he shows up here. I have no idea how he'll react to seeing me.'
'Just got back from waiting outside the clinic again. Still no sign of Tim.'
'@nickwilliams666 They probably wouldn't buy that, with doctor patient confidentiality and all.'
'Can't just walk into the clinic and ask about Tim. Not sure how to approach this.'
'It has the hours posted, at least.'
'Found what I think is a mental health clinic a few blocks down from the store. It's closed right now though.'
'She remembered Tim. Told me he mentioned going to a doctor's office.'
'Different person working here this time. Hoping they've seen Tim.'
'Back at the store. A lot less people here this time.'
'The empty room I was in last time is just full of books now. Didn't see that weird painting anywhere either. http://t.co/85gHGXG3'
'Lost her again. I'm just going to come back tomorrow when the sale is over.'
'Just asked her if she's seen Tim but she said she didn't know who I was talking about. Don't think she really heard me.'
'Think I found the owner, but she's busy.'
'There's no one up at the counter, either.'
'None of these people are Tim, though.'
'There's a ton of people in here. Must be a hell of a sale.'
'About to head over to the store. Hopefully someone there can tell me about Tim.'
'Drove by the store today. They had hung up a "going out of business sale" sign, still closed though. Surely they'll be open this week?'
'Made it back outside. I'm leaving before the guy comes back out and recognizes me.'
'He just went upstairs. Sounds like he's dragging something heavy across the floor. I'm taking a chance and getting out of here.'
'He's wandering around the store looking for something, I think. I really hope it's not in this room.'
'He's talking on his phone with someone. Said he's done with all the deliveries except for one.'
'Just heard the truck pull up behind the store. Hiding.'
'The person in the center has a weird face. It's just two circles and a nose. But the rest of the picture is so detailed.'
'And this one. Looks similar to the other. http://t.co/0isqQ0Ik'
'One of the few left. http://t.co/4tND9dsu'
'One of the rooms is nearly empty. Only a few paintings left. Maybe it's the room that guy was taking stuff out of?'
'@MrSkolVikes28 All the display cases are locked.'
'One of the other display cases is full of dolls. http://t.co/S6vBdcQ5'
'Found a pile of old cameras in one of the display cases. http://t.co/EokeRNam'
'Lots of paintings of wooded areas in here. http://t.co/5DNlkzdD'
'Looking around. http://t.co/OUjO3HZj'
'I don't see anyone else in there right now so I'm going inside. http://t.co/Duo28khF'
'He just left. I didn't see him lock the back door though.'
'He hasn't seen Tim. Told me he's the delivery driver for the store, so he's rarely sitting behind the counter inside.'
'Going to go around to the back and ask him if he's seen Tim around, whenever he comes back out.'
'The guy in the truck showed up again outside the store a few minutes ago.'
'@SOREN2011 No, I did not.'
'.@ZamAfRocs He unlocked the back door himself, so he's probably an employee.'
'He just left. He had loaded up a few large boxes in the back of his truck. I guess he was some kind of delivery driver?'
'I also asked if it would ever be open again. He said it will, since they're trying to sell off their current inventory.'
'Just asked him when the store will be open. He said it's in the process of closing down for good.'
'Some guy just got out of the truck and went in through the back of the store. Gonna go try and talk to him when he comes out.'
'A truck just pulled up behind the building. No one's gotten out of it for a few minutes.'
'Outside the store again. Trying to look inconspicuous on the bench across the street. Not sure if I'm succeeding at that or not.'
'Showed up early this morning at the store to see if anyone ever came. Nothing as of yet. Lights were on inside, though. http://t.co/EmbG787L'
'Accidentally slept late today. I think I'm going to try and go back to that store really early soon and just wait for someone to show up.'
'Store's still closed. I looked through the window, and it seemed like an antique store of some kind?'
'Back in the downtown area. The store that Tim walked out of when I saw him is always closed when I'm here. No hours posted either.'
'This place is the epitome of a small town. Almost everything is closed on Sundays.'
'There has to be somewhere around here that Tim would frequent.'
'@rulerofeden Not yet, I've asked a few random people around town but came up with nothing.'
'@poristhead Whenever something happens worth putting on the channel.'
'Didn't sleep for the entire weekend. Feeling dead.'
'@msmarvelli Don't think so. Can't really remember though.'
'Couldn't sleep last night. First time that's happened in a while.'
'Drove by Rosswood Park today. Almost stopped, but then I realized that's a terrible idea. Why did I even consider it?'
'@SwagBruceington That's the problem. I don't trust anyone.'
'Going to look outside of the downtown area soon. There is still Rosswood park, but I'm not going there alone.'
'No luck again. Maybe Tim isn't a regular around here and it was just a lucky coincidence that I saw him when I did?'
'No luck today. Maybe there will be more people there tomorrow.'
'Getting back out there today. Maybe I'll ask some people around downtown if they've seen anyone that looks like Tim.'
'@BraveDave88 I'm not going to say anything for sure.'
'I've been sleeping much too well recently. It's an odd change of pace.'
'No sign of Tim as of right now. Still in the downtown area.'
'Entry #52 has been reuploaded with the typo fixed: http://t.co/GuTKRFjW'
'Typo in entry #52. I'll reupload it tomorrow fixed.'
'Entry #52: http://t.co/oai2jNnj'
'Having serious computer issues. Uploading will have to wait until tomorrow. Too tired to keep trying.'
'Got delayed. Gonna give it another hour.'
'Entry #52 should be uploaded in about an hour.'
'Finally here. I'm going to have a look around while it's still light out.'
'Still driving. I'm going to try and have Entry #52 uploaded tomorrow night.'
'Making a trip to somewhere I never thought I'd go back to.'
'On the last tape now.'
'Almost to the last tape. Been moving around so much lately.'
'Entry #51: http://t.co/HwcCYNbl'
'Video problems again. Great. I'm going to hold off on uploading Entry 51 until tomorrow. Too tired to keep waiting.'
'Entry #51 will be posted tonight, but I'm not sure how soon.'
'Found it.'
'Finally have a chance to look through the mass of tapes for the 56-42 label.'
'Really paranoid. Had to change my location after I woke up with my hotel room door standing wide open. Nothing seems to be missing, though.'
'Entry #50: http://t.co/oD5li5do'
'Entry #50 is having some rendering problems. It will be uploaded in about an hour and a half, I think.'
'Also just now saw ToTheArk's response: http://t.co/IPe8nYLN Looks like the guy Alex attacked around the :22 mark...'
'There's a lot here to get through. Entry #50 will be posted tomorrow.'
'Think I may have found what came before the unlabeled footage in Entry #38.'
'@GreyouTT Yes, I've checked everything. Found nothing.'
'@GreyouTT Then wouldn't there be a news story about it somewhere at least? I can't find anything.'
'@MrSkolVikes28 That's what I'm hoping to find soon. There's not that many tapes left.'
'Giving up on finding missing person reports. Getting back to the tapes.'
'STILL nothing on a missing person. I can't figure it out.'
'@punxtr It's possible, but he doesn't really look homeless to me.'
'So far, I've found absolutely nothing about a missing person. I feel like I've looked everywhere, too.'
'Looking for any reports of a missing person around the area and time Entry #49 took place.'
'Entry #49: http://t.co/HBcOOX6'
'Entry #49 will be uploaded in about 30 minutes.'
'But right now I'm feeling really exhausted. Entry #49 will be uploaded tomorrow.'
'Been thinking about it, and it might be best if I upload what happened in the park. Just in case anything happens to me one day.'
'Finished looking through Alex's footage in the park. I don't want to share what I've seen.'
'ToTheArk responds. It's never been this fast before, as far as I remember. http://t.co/osFA30I'
'@thor9356 I've tried many, many times. No answer.'
'I'm pretty sure it's a camera bag that Alex was carrying around, but that doesn't guarantee there's a camera in it.'
'Starting to look through Alex's footage from when I was following him.'
'Entry #48: http://t.co/1IWmInt'
'The upload to youtube is going strangely slow. Probably about 30 minutes to go.'
'I've put a few things together. Entry #48 will be uploaded before I try and get some sleep tonight.'
'@TjArvidsson Nothing out of the ordinary, from what I can tell. Kind of frustrating to watch.'
'There's a LOT of footage of me just tailing Alex. So far, it looks like he didn't notice me.'
'Having trouble sleeping again. More so than usual, I mean.'
'Entry #47: http://t.co/fz7F7kF'
'By my reasoning, after Alex grabbed the tape from me, I took the key as I ran out just to have SOMETHING. Not 100% sure, of course.'
'Entry #46: http://t.co/oD7hKmI'
'Entry #46 will be posted later tonight.'
'@ItsMogkiKupo Who knows. I guess I'll find out soon enough.'
'Finding a lot of footage of me tailing Alex without him knowing it.'
'It's getting even harder to keep the footage from Alex and the footage from me straight.'
'Entry #45: http://t.co/6CLuKwN'
'@Nick22490 Not yet, no. Don't know what to make of that.'
