'@Fab_Uni @lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Iacoguy We were too busy burying our dead &amp; searching for bodies. And Bush backed off stupidly'
'@Fab_Uni @lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Iacoguy Someone else on the thread shared it, &amp; info why Bush backed away (huge mistake)'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @dancingqueen905 @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy Hey guy, were you in NYC on 9/11? Because it did happen.'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Fab_Uni @Waorguy @Iacoguy um, I've been saying it since THAT NIGHT! 9/11. I have no idea when Trump said it!'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Fab_Uni @Waorguy @Iacoguy lol you obviously don't get around much, don't know many people! So many NYers are libs!'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Fab_Uni @Waorguy @Iacoguy Yea usually when people witness something it becomes proven. Case in point, a court case?'
'@babadooky @Fab_Uni @lalger2020 @Waorguy @Iacoguy Sadly they are. We keep saying how we all saw it so they can't deny it happened.'
'@babadooky @Waorguy @lalger2020 @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy but you can see what we mean about hush-hushing it? It was reported, then gone.'
'@babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy basically debated me whether or not Muslims were cheering on 911 &amp;that if it was it was only a few.'
'@lalger2020 sorry you don't recall it like I do here in NY. Gotta feed my kids. Goodnight!'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy priority was Search &amp; rescue. And someone put the kabosh on it purposely never shown again'
'@lalger2020 I don't think they showed rooftops of big buildings I'm the middle east'
'@lalger2020 then why do we all remember it being Jersey? Why not Staten Island or Brooklyn? They were shown watching the smoke from roofs!'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy celebrating. Thousands in just Jersey? Not sure. Maybe. My best answer would be hundreds'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy Can't answer that. I know I saw thousands of Muslims celebrating. I saw Jersey Muslims'
'@lalger2020 no one knew all the facts. We heard reports car bombs were going off in Times Square &amp; bombs going off at NYU. Really bad.'
'@lalger2020 How old were you on 9/11? Do you remember clearly? I do. Worst day ever. But the reports were awful, things were confusing b/c'
'@lalger2020 but again we were distraught &amp; they were reporting multiple AWFUL scenes.'
'@lalger2020 i don't know how many exactly. It looked like a ton.I could believe it was thousands but also could believe it was only hundreds'
'@lalger2020 I saw thousands of Muslims celebrating the night of 9/11. I know they said NJ but also were reporting ME. How many from where?'
'@lalger2020 but we DID see it! The local NYC metro news showed it. I wish someone in the news would be honest, I'm SURE they still have ftg'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy I'm sorry you can't believe my account &amp; what others have recalled. This IS true'
'@lalger2020 celebrating,why am I bringing a child into this hateful world as possibly thousands died today from terror".RP,I never forgot it'
'@lalger2020 I was pregnant with my oldest. Lived in NYC, minutes from NJ. I remember thinking "we were attacked, our neighbors are'
'@lalger2020 Zero footage doesn't mean didn't happen. Again, coverage that nite went back &amp;forth Ground Zero,NJ, M.E. it appeared thousands.'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy yes, we saw thousands celebrating. Were they all from Jersey? 17 yrs later in not sure. It was just awful.'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy Yes. But the news kept showing clips going from GroundZero to Jersey to the Mid East then back again. So,'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy I'm not saying he doesn't lie, but I can assure you, THIS happened. Please be open to it'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy I still talk to other NY'ers who remember it. It happened. The news reported then pulled'
'@lalger2020 Me, my family, friends, we all remember. It was awful. In the midst of showing horror, news showed Muslims cheering here &amp; in ME'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy We saw it once. That nite. It's like the news were told to never cover again, but we all saw 😞So sad.'
'@lalger2020 @babadooky @Waorguy @Fab_Uni @Iacoguy I'm sure 100s of reporters did. How can you expect one man to remember who wrote what?'
