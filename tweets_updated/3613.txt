'@bbloggersCA @MAKEUPFOREVERCa I am way too excited about trying the new matte liquid lipsticks #CBBLove'
'@sydnee_xo @bbloggersCA @MyAvonCanada thanks so much!'
'@bbloggersCA @MyAvonCanada thanks for the üíó #CBBLove'
'@bbloggersCA I have a huge stash of them and always forget to actually use them... #CBBLove'
'@bbloggersCA @LOCCITANE_CA Sublime Toner comes to mind. It's so pink (the bottle, anyway) #CBBLove https://t.co/Ue6J3qch0O'
'@wrkreads @bbloggersCA @sydnee_xo I've recently come to love reverse stamping (and decal making) and find it so much easier than on the nail'
'@bbloggersCA @OPICanada my stamping skills need work, but I love this! #CBBLove'
'@FrankiieBeauty @bbloggersCA I almost went black too... I love nail art but a solid glossy shade is just so good.'
'@bbloggersCA üòÑ I need to be pressured into it apparently! #CBBLove'
'@bbloggersCA @CosmeticProof @DuriCosmetics all this nail art makes me feel like such a slacker #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA too cute! #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA I'm terrible and didn't even do Valentine nails... I'm wearing @OPI_PRODUCTS You Don't Know Jaques #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA @MAKEUPFOREVERCa @theNotice it's so pretty on skin! I it's the only highlight I've been using lately #CBBlove'
'@FrankiieBeauty @bbloggersCA @NyxCosmetics it's so pretty though. One of my faves from them #CBBlove'
'@wrkreads @AnnabelleTweets @bbloggersCA a perfect shade!'
'@bbloggersCA currently I'm all about Charlotte Tilbury Love Glow. I tend to stick to nudey-natural toned pinks #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA @GlitterDiaries LOVE the red on red. That shadow looks incredible. #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA @stephh_lau @lancomecanada I always think I'll branch out, but I just love classic black too much #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA @stephh_lau @lancomecanada üòÑ in reality I'd probably only use it once, but it looks so good on her #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA @stephh_lau @lancomecanada is it wrong I want that liner to match with my hair?'
'@bbloggersCA I used to avoid both, but as long as you ground it with darker liner it can look amazing (and not pink eye-ish) #CBBlove'
'@bbloggersCA @theNotice @Clinique these are so stinking cute'
'@FrankiieBeauty @bbloggersCA aww congrats! On the engagement obviously, but pandas are adorable too üòÑ'
'@bbloggersCA @Shiseido_Canada @CrystalCandy such perfect swatches!'
