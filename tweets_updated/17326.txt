'@writesdave @Sierratp I'd say that one totally depends on the situation! But can definitely provide stress-relieving benefits'
'@RyanHaunfelder @Sierratp Can also look to see when they last took a deload week! #trailtime'
'@RyanHaunfelder @Sierratp Always look @ nutrition, also how long they've been doing their current program, what type of periodization, etc.'
'@TrainWithBain @purpleosh @MikeOffTheMap LOL! Most of my clients do not, but there are some who love 'em!'
'@hdubswyo @Sierratp For heart health? aim for 30 minutes of moderate cardio (even just walking) most days per week.#trailtime'
'Ha! A good program that includes lots of glute-dominate movements like hip thrusts, RDL's, lunges, etc. https://t.co/twZj25NoJu'
'Q9: What’s your favorite pre- and/or post-workout snack? #trailtime'
'Q7: Tell us about your favorite way to work out or stay active. #trailtime'
'@hdubswyo @Sierratp Running trails&gt;any other running out there for me!! Takes the "dread" out of it :) #trailtime'
'RT @purpleosh: @TrainerPaige A5: I love the swimming pool at my gym in winter.. empty. More swim time, less jogging/running. Yay! #trailtime'
'This is my fav genre for lifting! https://t.co/eLIk4UHuij'
'@MikeOffTheMap Ha! I love it (And now that theme song is stuck in my head) #trailtime'
'Q5: How do you adjust your workouts according to season? Is it hard to stay active in the winter? #trailtime'
'@RCGibby73 @Sierratp Same - for me it depends on the type of workout. Running = totally different from lifting. #trailtime'
'@RCGibby73 All really great points. Plus, a well written plan ensures more progress #trailtime'
'@nwnaturecalls I need to teach my dog that trick! ;) #trailtime'
'Q3: Do you have a workout plan or do you just wing it? #trailtime'
'@nwnaturecalls YES! Awesome way to garner some motivation. #trailtime'
'@Sierratp I remind myself that I am *always* glad I did it once I get out there #trailtime'
'@sethayates Well, research says self-efficacy increases your success rate, so that's good you're able to tackle your goals ;)'
'@nwnaturecalls That's amazing!! Congrats :) #trailtime'
'@RCGibby73 Being prepared - and having some strategies in place is key! Good for you for recognizing it #trailtime'
