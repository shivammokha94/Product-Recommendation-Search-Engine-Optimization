'@PurelyNumbers @RunSuperBooRun Could also be that you're running wrong paces on workouts during training. Or not enough mileage.'

'@RunSuperBooRun well, there ya go!'
'@RunSuperBooRun no. denim would be better or a heavier cotton/twill. sorry.'
'@MarathonGary 40 degrees in May + running  sounds like a dream! Enjoy your race!!'
'@runinhighheels oh girl, no one wants to tear up their Lulu!!! I'd be the same way! I wear my ol' Nike capris for trails.'
'@runinhighheels I wear capris because I am a fall risk. lol'
'@thegogirlblog thank you!!!'
'@thegogirlblog I had no idea! ha. This month?'
'@thegogirlblog what?!?! Link???'
'@jaystancil @kf4pch @RunSuperBooRun new course, yes. I'll be at registration and somewhere to cheer, possibly.'
'@RunSuperBooRun Catalyst would be a perfect addition to that. Not just for the sparkiness. @kf4pch'
'@kf4pch I only tried it once. It was super sweet to me. I rarely even drink Nuun anymore tho. I love water. @RunSuperBooRun'
'@RunSuperBooRun Catalyst is great for  enhancing endurance and muscle. Lots of benefits. @kf4pch'
'@kf4pch I can imagine just based on the context..I think. Ugh. Ok.  @RunSuperBooRun'
'@kf4pch @RunSuperBooRun thank goodness.'
'@RunSuperBooRun @kf4pch lol that's rather interesting....'
'@kf4pch Oh Johnny!! email me... kimert@comcast.net and I'll get you all the details! It's a great prod &amp; I don't want to be all sales pitchy'
'@kf4pch thanks. i feel better than i have. i missed my catalyst yesterday and could totally tell!  helps to be consistent w/that.'
'@kf4pch interesting. I don't have an issue with water and prefer it only when I run. I think the further I get into this I will try more.'
'@kf4pch Awesome! I have heard good things about the 02 gold. I love catalyst. I am not a Spark fan, agree w/you on that. I stick to water.'
'@emily_runs Good luck!!!'
'@kf4pch I did a cleanse a yr ago. This is my first 24 day challenge. I'm on day 11. I feel so good!'

'@jaimemckee I rarely leave for lunch. They're use to me packing my stuff (gym bag/ lunch) and staying in. Sucks ppl make comments!'
'@jaimemckee and the only to set an example! Nice!!'
'@RunSuperBooRun exactly. don't wish, do.  @jaimemckee'
'@jaimemckee Gotcha. You have a lot of conveniences!'
'@jaimemckee You work local, I assume? We are a small (3 of us) office. So I bring my lunch. They guys go out.'
'@RunSuperBooRun more than 0. and what's holding you back?  @jaimemckee'
'@RunSuperBooRun @jaimemckee 5 plus lifting for me at 5pm! Woohoo.'
'@jaimemckee Another reason it pays to not have co-workers! The guys I work w/go out to eat every single day! I'd die (and be huge).'
'@RunSuperBooRun among other things. just gross. i don't want to see a single soul run nude. ever. @jaystancil'

'@jaystancil 1st I thought you were serrious &amp; was gna say I still can't race. Then I clicked it. LMAO yeah, no. @RunSuperBooRun'
'@jaimemckee I have no idea when it is even in the forecast. lol I rarely pay attention. But hopefully it won't rain on your event.'
'@jaystancil bahahahah to pollen and heat. i'll be clothed, sir! lol @RunSuperBooRun'
'@jaimemckee Rain this weekend may help a little!'
'@RunSuperBooRun I'm hoping the more I expose myself the better my body adjusts. Has been the case in the past.'
'@jaimemckee the more you run in the heat the better you acclimate. it takes a little time. I just can't do the TM.'
'@RunSuperBooRun pollens killing me too, but I popped the pills and will still hit it. I cannot stand the TM under any circumstances.'
'88 degrees this evening. Ah, bring it on Mother Nature! What doesn't kill me ..... #run #runchat #springishere'
