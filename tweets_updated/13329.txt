'@FitFluential @TimexSports Thanks! Great chat tonight. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential A8: @Mirindacarfrae because she's so stinkin' FAST and maybe just maybe a little would rub off on me. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential A7: Not big on running at dark. Thankfully I can run during the day after I drop the kids off at school. #ONEGPS+'
'@CertifiedFitGk @FitFluential Thank YOU! #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports A6: No running just swimming 3500 meters today. Can the watch track that? Please say yes. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential Swoon. I NEED this watch. The hubby can go take a nap at the hotel and be alerted when I'm 15 minutes from finish??? #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential Haha only for the first 15 minutes. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports 14/15/16 (?) hours for my Ironman is sure going to kill them. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports Short race my kids/husband. Anything over 3 hours &amp; kids are bored &amp; hubby is asking: "how much longer." #ONEGPS+'
'@CertifiedFitGk @FitFluential Thank you. Only impressive if I get to the finish. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports A4: When those doubts creep in just before your race, seeing all your hard work helps you feel better. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential That.is.AWESOME. #ONEGPS+'
'@urbanfitopia @FitFluential @richroll I listen to him as well. Love his podcasts! #ONEGPS+'
'@CertifiedFitGk @FitFluential It's a full Ironman. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports A4: So many to pick from. My fav right now is Remember The Name by Fort Minor #ONEGPS+'
'@CertifiedFitGk @FitFluential Good way to do it. Right now I'm Zone 2 training just for time. Hoping it'll get me to finish the entire 140.6'
'@runfastermommy @FitFluential @TimexSports Looking forward to reading the review! #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential A3: I can tell I am getting stronger based on the length of my runs and more importantly, how I feel afterward. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports A2: Like a new mom, ready to tackle ANYTHING my kids will throw at me (sometimes literally). #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports A1: I continue to run because it's the only way I'll get to cross that Ironman finishline. #ONEGPS+'
'@FitFluential @TimexSports A1: needed an outlet for my post partum depression, running helped tremendously with that. #ONEGPS+'
'@suzy399 @FitFluential I'm glad to hear you are loving it so far. Congrats on being selected! Stoked for you! #ONEGPS+'
