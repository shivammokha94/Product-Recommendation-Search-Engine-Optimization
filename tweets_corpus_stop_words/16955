give second think what anyone would think about maybe combination think know would ever read anything there maybe this be naive young blind confidence know there something organic about share thoughts experience just felt easy flip side be do create things whole life find that same kind comfo share be difficult architecture school dread have bring model draft crits matter confident work would panic what they didn didn like what awful want tell face think constantly get judge creative expression make anxious that transfer major same thing happen with english remember be fiction workshop read page chapter that write loud whole class then critique honest surprise didn have panic attack while read think what come down difference between share what look like what versus really open about really sure very transparent even share thoughts feel they about things that happen things that do with write difference opinion that more subconscious which make more intimate personal rest comment some people ask recently about process paint look they watch this video back speed definitely look like just dump paint canvas move around hope best wish be that easy kind hard explain maybe into more detail about when actually figure verbalize what exactly go into make these piece meantime here sneak peak dump paint canvas hop best justtt kid this piece from collection that will available friday double gesso acrylic stretch canvas always think that abstract this magical loophole world where could never mess anything though someways that true learn from personal experience that actually accurate least always when paint into with plan have recipes color mixtures that come back make sure paint same exact viscosity every single time literally just what ever feel right that moment what awesome about do that that every single paint completely unique never replicate what suck about do that that every single paint completely unique never replicate though into with plan expectations sometimes pour guide paint around canvas this incredibly easy intuitive experience other time guide paint just like what actual fuck incredibly frustrate here lie lesson learn about fact mess abstract might mix wrong ratios paint guide paint wrong direction try fight force something never intend look like paint this sit there with tiny brush try recreate this image have head just allow whatever though really hard especially when know make these powerful piece that resonate with people myself judge upset when make piece that look like those whenever make piece that know different than others easy want change more paint force move another direction that what ruin always rest caption this go home last week along with others gallery wall series though these be commission paint always surprise hard with them though they abstract they have their unique energy because where what think about while paint them think that probably hard give them away sometimes because they essentially little piece extensions this paicular series felt incredibly cathaic because create during such chaotic transitional time paint them felt ground act reminder ever staed paint first place much hard them excite them hang together they couldn have go better home wait share final product with guy soon people dimensional creatures perhaps that many wonderful be human understand much change over past years appearance persona social media shift with that evolution clear try beat around bush pull over guy question still into fitness personal train bodybuilding answer that question creativity paint mean have be paint since go design school years then catch with life didn really find that love paint again until last year have be paint consistently ever since just like many other people have more than hobby more than talent more than passion staed social media validation attention share thoughts view experience with others over years focus mostly be about fitness because that where life that season creative most impoant most impoant create anything process itself that true anything life right many want before even begin want that final product result answer without investment time effo resources paint example last thing want huge canvas prime with gesso wait paint find perfect viscosity cover entire apament with tarp stare canvas thousand years pray fuck finally paint then chase around apament try paint over paw which always somehow manage then have that literally ever sometimes blow areas paint efficiency keep paint layer rinse repeat have clean brush squeegee bucket then have clean white sink pray tarp clean residual paint that inevitably couch floor wall then finally finally have this beautiful paint finish hell process that process feel chaotic messy sometimes tedious figure when say do have this paint that either keep give whoever commission feel proud like holy shit make that literally craft this piece there never go another paint quite like this that impoant remember effo time resources typically be mean rest comment nan
